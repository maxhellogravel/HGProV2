# Project Context — Hello Gravel Pro (HG Pro)

## What is HG Pro
Hello Gravel Pro ("HG Pro") is a professional ordering and account portal built for **specialty subcontractors and property management teams** who need fast, reliable access to aggregate materials across multiple markets.

These customers often operate in **new or changing geographies** where they do not have long-standing supplier relationships. When they need materials, they need them **quickly, confidently, and without friction**.

HG Pro exists to replace ad-hoc phone calls, supplier hunting, and manual quoting with a **simple, trusted, repeatable workflow**.

## Who it's for
Primary users:
- Specialty subcontractors
- Property management operators
- Teams working across multiple markets or job sites

Common traits:
- Time-constrained
- Operationally focused (not browsing, not researching)
- Value speed, clarity, and reliability over novelty
- Comfortable either calling a rep or self-serving online

## Core user needs
HG Pro users need to:
- Get material **fast**
- Know pricing **quickly and clearly**
- Reorder or repeat past jobs without starting over
- Have a human contact when things are urgent or complex
- Maintain visibility into billing, payments, and credit

They should never feel:
- Lost between markets
- Unsure who to contact
- Slowed down by unnecessary steps or unclear pricing

## Mental model
HG Pro should feel like:
- "My trusted aggregate supplier, everywhere I work"
- A mix of **white-glove account management** and **self-serve speed**
- A professional tool, not a consumer shopping experience

## What the portal enables
The HG Pro portal allows users to:

- Easily find and contact:
  - Their Hello Gravel Account Manager
  - Hello Gravel Customer Service

- Order materials with minimal friction:
  - Few-click checkout
  - Fast pricing and quoting
  - Quotes based on material type and delivery address
  - Clear delivery expectations

- Manage their account in one place:
  - View order history
  - Reorder or reference past jobs
  - Request updates, documentation, or support within the portal

- Handle billing and payments:
  - View payment information
  - Understand account status
  - See credit line and related details

## Guiding principles
- Speed beats completeness
- Clarity beats cleverness
- Familiar workflows beat novelty
- Human support is always visible and accessible
- The portal should reduce calls — but make calling easy when needed

## What not to assume
- Users will explore or "learn" the product
- Users have time to compare options
- Users want complex configuration
- Users trust automated systems without clear human backup

The product should earn trust through reliability, transparency, and responsiveness — not marketing language.
